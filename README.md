## Interesting Facts about Fractals

- Fractals are infinitely complex mathematical patterns that repeat infinitely at different scales.
- Fractals can be found in nature, such as in the branching patterns of trees, the shapes of clouds, and the structure of coastlines.
- Fractals have practical applications in various fields, including computer graphics, data compression, and modeling natural phenomena.
- Fractals exhibit self-similarity, meaning that they contain smaller copies of themselves within their structure.
